**1 Find your motivation**

Since taking up a position in industry following the completion of my PhD in Economics at Tilburg University, a number of PhD students and early career researchers have approached me with questions regarding the transition from academia to industry: How to sell your PhD experience to the private sector? What skills are most valued? How does the career path for someone with a PhD look like in the private sector? The list goes on. So I decided to start a regular series of posts where I share some of the lessons I learned from my own transition from academia to industry, tips that helped me navigate it, and overall insights from the experience so far.

These posts will be mostly based on my personal experience as an applied microeconomist transitioning to a health economics research consultancy firm. Some of the tips and insights, however, will be general enough and can be directly applied to other fields of study. My hope is that this series of posts is a helpful resource for some of the PhD students and early career researchers out there who want to make a transition to industry, but do not know how to get started.

Many a times, I hear PhD students saying that grad school did not prepare them to navigate the transition from academia to industry. While one could discuss whether universities should more actively help their graduate students transitioning to industry, my idea is that you should be the one prepare yourself for a transition from academia to industry. And, indeed, the very first step requires you to do some introspection and figure out why you want to transition to the private sector to begin with.

I was asked about my motivation to transition to industry in most interviews I had with organizations in the private sector. I was also often asked how sure I was about my decision to leave academia. I would say that these were crucial questions in the interviews. So you definitely want to think about your own motivations beforehand and have a clear and honest reply ready for when these questions come up. There are many possible ways to answer these questions, but I think a great way to go about it is to focus on the characteristics of your dream job and what you want your career to look like, rather than focusing on the reasons why you are leaving academia.

Often your interviewers will have PhDs as well and might even have spent part of their careers in academia. They will probably ask you about your PhD journey. What did you like the most? What was the most difficult part? The most fun part? What do you expect to be the main challenges you will face in adapting to work outside academia? If you give these questions a good thought and are honest with yourself, then your answers to them will reinforce each other and produce a coherent narrative.

I think introspection is a crucial first step before taking action. If you want to change your career, but do not know what you actually want your career to look like, you might be setting yourself up for failure and disappointment. You should figure out what you want before starting to send applications or investing time and money on a certain skillset. By carefully thinking about what you value and what you want your career to look like, you will be saving everyoneâ€™s time â€“especially yours ðŸ˜Š
