# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Tilburg University. My supervisors are [Martin Salm](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/martin-salm) and [Jan Boone](https://janboone.github.io/homepage/). My research investigates the effects of public policy on the healthcare system and health outcomes. 

I will join the health economics group at [ZEW](https://www.zew.de/en/) as a post-doctoral researcher starting in fall 2021.

I am affiliated with the [Health Economics & Management Knowledge Center](https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/health) at Nova School of Business and Economics, Lisbon. 

Together with [Christoph Kronenberg](https://sites.google.com/view/christoph-kronenberg/home), I organize V-MESS, a virtual seminar on the economics of mental health. Click [here](https://sites.google.com/view/christoph-kronenberg/home/vmess?authuser=0) for all the details.
