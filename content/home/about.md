# About me

I am a health economist interested in improving decision-making in areas that directly impact individual well-being.

In October 2021, I joined [OPEN Health](https://pharmerit.com) as a Senior Research Analyst with the Modelling and Meta-Analysis team in Rotterdam.

I will receive a Ph.D. in Economics from [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu) on November 3, 2021. My doctoral research investigates the effects of public policies on the healthcare system and health outcomes. I am affiliated with the [Health Economics & Management Knowledge Center](https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/health) at Nova School of Business and Economics, Lisbon.
